PittHack
========

Hackathon project for Pitt, looking to create an SMS based information retreival system to empower those without smartphones to wield the internet's knowledge


It currently has three functionalities:
  - Wikipedia query (with paging)
  - Tweet reader for any given user (with paging)
  - Wolfram Alpha querying
  
  
Looking forward from the Pitt Hackathon weekend, we look to incorporate different language functionalities, increase the robustness of our exisiting uses, and (of course) include more faucets of information.



Huge shout out to guh6 for working iwth me on this all weekend!
